**Welcome, Penguicon 2024 attendees!**

I put this website and the [corresponding Github repo](https://github.com/opensourcerelationships/opensourcerelationships.github.io) together at the last minute before the con so that it can be unveiled at the [Open Souce Relationships panel](https://sched.co/1aFdB). 

This is more than a website. This is the genesis of a platform to build a community and organize resources for the purpose of education, growth, and most importantly, love. 

Nothing is set in stone, but I hope to put my 20 years of software and web development to good use through this journey. 

We will discuss next steps at the panel, so if you are seeing this, but you can't make it to Penguicon, stay tuned for more information!
